# SQL Queries About DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language)

In this repository, I've created a database schema in the Third Normal Form (3NF) to model a hypothetical scenario where a sports event is taking place. The schema is designed to handle various aspects of the event.

To build and interact with this database, I've written SQL scripts including both Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands. The DDL commands are used to create the database structure, while the DML commands are used to query and manipulate the data to meet various requirements of the sports event.

Feel free to explore the SQL scripts and provide any feedback or contributions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the GitHub CLI command:
   ```shell
   gh repo clone Shahariar-Rokon/SQL-Queries
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository page: https://github.com/Shahariar-Rokon/SQL-Queries
2. **Set up the database**:
   To setup you can start by create the database SportsDB 1st. 
   Now you should use the DDL file to create the necessary tables.
3. **Run the SQL file**:
   To run the SQL files, you should run one block at a time. Note that if you run all at once, it wont show how each section works.
4. Software recommendation:
   You need to use MS SQL server and SQL server management studio.

## Usage

Each section of the SQL file is marked with a comment line (`--`) followed by a description of the action performed by that section. 

To use these queries:

1. Open the SQL file in your preferred SQL client.
2. Run each line one at a time. You can usually do this by placing your cursor on the line and executing the 'Run' command in your SQL client.

That's it! You're good to go. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue in this GitHub repository.
